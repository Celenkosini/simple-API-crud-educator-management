# Educator Management System

This is a simple Spring Boot application for managing educator information. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting educator records.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
* Maven
* (Optional) Postman or curl for testing API endpoints

## Setup and Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd educator-management-system
    ```

3.  **Run the application using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4.  **Access the H2 console (optional):**
    * Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`.
    * Use the following JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:educatorsdb`.
    * Leave the username and password fields blank.

## API Endpoints

* **`GET /educators`**: Retrieves a list of all educators.
* **`GET /educators/{id}`**: Retrieves an educator by their ID.
* **`POST /educators`**: Creates a new educator.
    * Request body (JSON):
        ```json
        {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "subject": "Mathematics",
          "email": "[email address removed]"
        }
        ```
* **`PUT /educators/{id}`**: Updates an existing educator.
    * Request body (JSON):
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "subject": "Physics",
          "email": "[email address removed]"
        }
        ```
* **`DELETE /educators/{id}`**: Deletes an educator by their ID.

## Testing

You can use Postman, curl, or any other API testing tool to test the endpoints.

**Example using curl:**

* **Get all educators:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/educators
    ```
* **Create a new educator:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Alice Smith", "subject": "Chemistry", "email": "[email address removed]"}' http://localhost:8080/educators
    ```

## Database

This application uses an in-memory H2 database. The database is initialized with the schema defined in the `Educator` entity class. The data is lost after the application is stopped.

## Future Improvements

* Implement authentication and authorization.
* Add search and filtering capabilities.
* Implement more complex data relationships (e.g., educators and courses).
* Add more extensive error handling and input validation.
* Use a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
* Add unit and integration tests.
* Add documentation with swagger
